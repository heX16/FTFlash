# FTFlash

**FTFlash is a Windows application for reading and writing FLASH memory in SPI chips using a FT232H.** A voltage regulator is required to step 5V down to 3.3V, but otherwise no external components are required. FTFlash allows for manual inspection of device information and reading/writing individual memory addresses as well as dumping/programming the entire memory to/from binary files on disk.

### Wiring

The photo of my breadboard shows a 0.1 ÂµF decoupling capacitor to ground placed the the 3.3V line next to the regulator. It's probably not mandatory, but is a good idea to include on the output rail of linear voltage regulators to smooth out high frequency noise on the the supply line.
